# Stock Price Trend Analysis using Random Forest

#Objective : 
The objective of this project is to analyze historical stock price data and
predict short-term price trends using a machine learning approach.

#Data Source : 
Historical stock price data is fetched programmatically from Yahoo Finance
using the yfinance Python library.

#Methodology : S
- Collected historical stock data from 01-01-2019 to 01-01-2026
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Created lag features and moving averages
- Trained a Random Forest regression model
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE

#Tools & Technologies :
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- yfinance
- Jupyter Notebook

#Results :
The model was able to capture general price trends, though exact price
prediction remains challenging due to market volatility.

#Limitations : 
Stock prices are influenced by external factors such as news and market
sentiment, which are not included in this model.

#Conclusion : 
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for
time-series stock data analysis and trend prediction.
